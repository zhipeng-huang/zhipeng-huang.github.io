Welcome to my homepage! 

My name is Zhipeng Huang, and I am a PhD candidate at the Mathematical Institute of Utrecht University in the Netherlands. I am currently working with my supervisor, [Prof. Kees Oosterlee](https://www.uu.nl/staff/CWOosterlee), on developing numerical methods for stochastic control and FBSDEs.

Before starting my PhD studies in the Netherlands, I worked at the School of Science and Engineering and the School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ) from 2018 to 2022. Prior to that, I worked as a research assistant with [Prof. Michael Choi](https://mchchoi.github.io/). I received my MSc in Financial Engineering from CUHK-SZ and my bachelor's degree in Economics from Guangzhou University.
